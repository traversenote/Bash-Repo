This script ranks [The Listening Post website](http://www.listeningpost.co.nz) against a list of it's competitors. It uses [Alexa.com](http://www.alexa.com) to get the rank.


Currently it only does a simple get and spit, but hopefully in the future I'll be able to make it update a little more dynamically.
