This is a collection of bash scripts I have written. Some are complete and functional, others are mere skeletons. 
I am using this as a way to keep track of the different versions of scripts I make, and have a play with Git.
You are free to use any of these scripts you would like, or to suggest improvements on any of them.
I'm not actively developing these at the moment though.
